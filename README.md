Bankruptcy Classification Project
Project Overview
The Bankruptcy Classification Project is a machine learning-based initiative aimed at predicting whether a company is likely to go bankrupt based on its financial data. Bankruptcy prediction is a critical task in the fields of finance, risk management, and investment analysis. By analyzing historical financial data, this project seeks to build a predictive model that can classify companies as either "bankrupt" or "non-bankrupt" with high accuracy.
